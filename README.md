## Overview of Project
### Analyzing two separate listings of stocks from 2017 and 2018 to calcuulate the total volume and return percentage. The code was refactored to loop through all of the tickers in the listing. 

## Results
The refactor code will update my workbook with data from 2017 and 2018 in 0.0703125 seconds. Below are screenshots for running each year.

When comparing return percentges for 2017 abd 2018, all of the stocks were significantly more profitable in 2017. Only one stock had a negative return in 2017 and four stocks had over a 100% return. In 2018, only the tickers of ENPH and Run did not have a negative return. Below are tables for both years.
