## Overview of Project
### Analyzing two separate listings of stocks from 2017 and 2018 to calculate the total volume and return percentage. The code was refactored to loop through all of the tickers in the listing. 

## Results
### Timer Results for 2017 and 2018
The refactored code will update my workbook with data from 2017 and 2018 in 0.0703125 seconds. Below are screenshots for running each year.

### Return Percentage for 2017 and 2018
When comparing return percentages for 2017 and 2018, all of the stocks were significantly more profitable in 2017. Only one stock had a negative return in 2017 and four stocks had over a 100% return. In 2018, only the tickers of ENPH and Run did not have a negative return. Below are tables for both years.

## Summary
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The purpose of refactoring code is to take an existing source code and identify more efficient way to run that code. Below are some advantages of refactoring code: 

- The initial code can often be written with more parameters than are needed. Refactoring gives you an opportunity to simplify the code. 
- A deeper understanding of the code should occur based on the refactoring. As you are questioning parameters, you will spend additional time reviewing the language and code used. 
- The output from the refactored code should be just a simplified version of the initial code that should be easier to maintain.

Some disadvantages to refactored code are: 
- Refactoring code takes time. If you have a short deadline, refactoring code may put the deadline at risk. 
- The process of refactoring is intended to clean up code and will not correct inefficiencies in the actual software being used.


### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The sole purpose of refactoring the code in this exercise was to identify a more efficient code to loop through the data. The refactoring of this code will allow for us loop through an entire listing of stocks. The two main cons of refactoring are the additional time that it takes to complete and the software limitations. Both of these disadvantages did not impact this assignment.
